### ðŸ”¥ PAR(Powerful-Agent-Researcher) ðŸ”¥
This project is an Agent Assistant that aims to automatically generate high-quality documents in response to user question. It conducts its own web searches and creates documents to provide answers.


**Main Features**
- **THLO(Think-High-Level-Outline)** : It deeply 'think' and 'inner monologue' to understands user question and automatically generates high-level-outline or plan for document creation.
- **Utilization of Various Information Sources** : It integrates multiple search engines, including Tavily, YouTube, arXiv, and Wikipedia, to gather comprehensive and intelligent information.
- **Intelligent Information Summarization and Integration** : It intelligently summarizes and integrates the collected information to automatically generate documents that are not only optimized for the user's question but also contain richer and high-quality information.

I'm actively seeking feedback and discussions!


### ðŸ”¥ A-SQL-A ðŸ”¥
This `A-SQL-A` project is similarly as this `QA-With-Jupyter`.


**Main Features**
- You can **Q&A** with your own `CSV` file.
- Automatically **transform** `.csv` to `.db`.
- Generate **SQL query** by LLM.
